/* A spaghetti stack is an N-ary tree data structure 
in which child nodes have pointers to the parent nodes
 (but not vice-versa)

Spaghetti stack structure is used in situations
 when records are dynamically pushed and popped
  onto a stack as execution progresses, 
  but references to the popped records remain in use.
